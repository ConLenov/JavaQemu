This repo is for recording code changes for JavaQemu software.

Mirroring information about JavaQemu:

JavaQemu is a Graphical User Interface Front End for QEMU, written in Java.
JavaQemu works with JRE 1.7/1.8 and MS Windows OS.
Since version 0.0.4a15, JavaQemu works with JRE 1.6 or Linux OS/Mac OS, too.
Since version 0.2.0a10, JavaQemu works only with JRE 1.7+.

This project is inactive again, because of the Covid-19.

I am sorry!

I would make only minor bugfixes for the JavaQemu software, because I am not focusing primarily on JavaQemu.
